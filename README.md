# mongoose-repository-pattern

A mongoDB repository pattern built on top of [Mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose) and utilizes [Typegoose](https://github.com/szokodiakos/typegoose) for its schema's.

## Motivation
If you come from the java environment you might be familiar with [Spring Data Repositories]( https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/data-commons/docs/1.6.1.RELEASE/reference/html/repositories.html), well this package offers rather the same approach. Its a repository pattern because it allows one to create a separate logic for accessing and manipulating data.
